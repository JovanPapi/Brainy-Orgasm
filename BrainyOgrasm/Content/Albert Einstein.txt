Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who
developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics.
His work is also known for its infuence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general
public for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc^2, which has been dubbed "the world's most
famous equation".
