A black hole is a region of spacetime exibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing-no
particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape from it.
The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form
black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although 
the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, locally detectable
features appear to be observed.
