In astronomy, a blue giant is a hot star with a luminosity class of III(giant) or II(bright giant). In the
standard Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, these stars lie above and to the right of the main sequence.
The term applies to a viriety of stars in different phases of development, all evolved stars that have moved
from the main sequence but have little else in common, so blue giant simply refers to stars in particular region
of the HR diagram rather than a speciffic type of star.
