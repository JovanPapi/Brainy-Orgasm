The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most 
invertebrate animals. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains
approximately 14-16 billions neurons, and estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55-70 billion. 
Physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest
of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormons.
