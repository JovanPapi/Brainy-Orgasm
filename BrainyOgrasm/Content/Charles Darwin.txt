biologist best known for this contributions to the science of evolution. Puzzled by the geographical distribution
of wildfire and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived
his theory of natural selection.
Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in
