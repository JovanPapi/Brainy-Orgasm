A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins 
to release gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere of coma and 
sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon
the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed 
of loose collections of ice, dust and small rocky particles.
