A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust and dark metter.
The word galaxy is derived from the Greek "literaly milky" a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size 
from dwarfs with just a few hundred million stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's 
center of mass.
