The Voyager Golden Records are two photograph records that were included aboard both Voyager
spacecraft launched in 1977. The record contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life
and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form, or for future humans, who
may find them. Although neither Voyager spacecraft is heading toward any particular star, Voyager 1 will pass within
1.6 light-years distance of the star Gliese 445, currently in the constellation Camelopardalis, in about 40 000 years.
