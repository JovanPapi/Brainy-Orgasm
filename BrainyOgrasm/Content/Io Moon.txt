Io is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter. It is the fourth largest moon,
has the highest density of all the moons and has the least amount of water of any known astronomical
object in the Solar System. With over 400 active vulcanoes, Io is the most geologically active object in the 
Solar System. This extreme geologic activity is the result of tidal heating from friction generated within Io's
interior as it is pulled between Jupiter and the other Galilean satelites: Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
