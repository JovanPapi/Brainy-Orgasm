Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, astronomer, theilogian, author and physicist who
is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientist of all time and a key figure in the scientific
revolution. Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour
based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. He also 
formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound and introduced
the notion of a Newtonian fluid.
