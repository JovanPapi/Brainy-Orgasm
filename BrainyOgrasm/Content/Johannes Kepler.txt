Johannes Kepler (December 1571 - 15 November 1630) was a German astronomer, mathematician
and a astrologer. He is key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution, best known for his laws
of planetary motion.
Kepler's first major astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum, was the first published defense of
the Copernican system. After failing to find unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical
observations(even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional 
polyhedra.
