A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gasses. Originally, nebula
was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond Milky Way. Most nebulae are of vast
size, some are hundreds of light-years in diameter. A nebula that is barely visible to the human eye from Earth
would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by.
The Orion Nebula is the brightest nebula and its size is twice as the size of the moon when we look in the sky and 
it can be viewed by naked eyes. A nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only few kilograms.
