Node.js is an open-source. cross-platform javascript run-time enviroinment that executes javascript
code server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
Consequently, Node.js represents a "Javascript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development
around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
