Otto Hahn was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He
is reffered to as the father of nuclear chemistry. Otto Hahn furthered the research begun by Enrico Fermi
and his team in 1934 when they bombarded uranium with neutrons. Until 1938, it was believed that the elements
with atomic numbers greater than 92 arose when uranium atoms were bombarded with neutrons.
As a chemist, Hahn was reluctant to propose a revolutionary discovery in physics.
However, Meitner and her nephew, the young physicist Otto Robert Frisch, in Sweden, came to the same conclusion (a "bursting") as 
Hahn and were able, because they had a lead of time, to work out the first theoretical interpretation of nuclear fission – the term 
that was coined by Frisch, and which subsequently became internationally known. Over the next few months, Frisch and Meitner 
published two articles discussing and experimentally confirming this hypothesis.
