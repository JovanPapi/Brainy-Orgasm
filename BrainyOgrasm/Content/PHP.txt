PHP(hypertext preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but
also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP code may be executed with a command line interface(CLI),
embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems
and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common
Gateway interface executable.
