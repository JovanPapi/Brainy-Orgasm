Powershell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting
of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally 
performed by cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. 
These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the file system or registry, which are made available to 
PowerShell via providers.
