Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van
Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphisizes code readability with its
notable use of significant whitespace. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple 
programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described 
as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released 2000, introduced 
features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles.
