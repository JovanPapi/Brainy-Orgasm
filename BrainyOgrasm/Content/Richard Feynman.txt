Richard Phillips Feynman (May 1918 -  15 February 1988) was an American theoretical physicist
known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum
electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid  helium. Feynman investigated the 
physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, where helium seems to display a complete lack of viscosity 
when flowing. Faynman provided a quantum-mechanical explanation for the Soviet physicist Lev Landau's theory of superfluidity.
Faynman inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler-Faynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laid the groundwork for the path
integral formulation and Faynman diagrams.
