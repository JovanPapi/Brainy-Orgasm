Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.
It was designed and developed in the mid 1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Matsumoto has said that Ruby was 
conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the ruby-talk mailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language.
Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of 
Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl.
