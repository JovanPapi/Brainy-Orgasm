The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma with
internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.
The Sun is a G-type main sequence star(G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not 
completely accurately reffered to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational
collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. 
The Sun is roughly middle-aged, it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion years, and will remain fairly stable
for more than another five billion years.
