Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented
and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let 
application developers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled java code can run on all platforms
that support java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on 
any java virtual machine(JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
